## Concepts
There are some concepts that describe general use cases, but they can be questioned in more sophisticated scenario so full potential of a platform will be utilized. For ex.: 3d AAA game will not be available on a text terminal. but chat or some kind of presence could.
 * Worlds should be open sourced in most basic scenarios
 * Most of the worlds should allow some access on all 4 dimensions (1, 2 , 3, AR)
 * List of worlds is maintained by the owner of each node 0/1/2
 * 1d worlds could be accessed also by GUI, so they could there is an option for having some boring business layer. For ex.: e-commerce, chat.
 * 1d could be accessible from 2d
 * 2d could be accessible from 3d
 * 3d could be accessible from AR - TBD
 * IDE for the MV should be available in 1d
